            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My name is Mitchell Lowry and I am based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I have very do-it-yourself attitude and I am an idea man. I love to always have a project to work on, whether is remodeling my house, or a new art project idea I have had or an idea for a new recipe or story to write. I always like to have a creative project ot work on the keep my mind sharp.</p>
            <p>I started working in the kitchens when I was 15 and just fell in love with that work. I was able to accomplish all of the things I wanted to in that field, and have enjoyed it for many years. Now after starting a family I wanted a career change. I just finished my UI design certification, and look forward to being in the design field which is a good mix of project and art, which I like.</p>
            <p>When designing I like to try and be unique and different without changing to much of the industry standards. I don't want to confuse the user. I like to look at an app and find a new feature I can add or change and element to be different to step it apart from what is on the marker already. This is how I approach each project I work on.</p>
