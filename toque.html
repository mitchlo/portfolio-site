        <p>I was tasked with creating, designing, and testing a responsive web application for recipes. I needed to come up with features in the app that would set me apart from what is on the market today. Along the way I was able to learn and use
          UX design and research and I was able to apply those findings into my final design. I would like to walk you through my process and the things I found to be most helpful and detrimental in my final product.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Through user research I was able to really focus on what was wanted. I then put together some user personas to help stay on target of designing for the user. I then was able to start putting my thoughts together for the direction of the
          app and what features I could think about including to make my app different from what is on the market.</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>With my background as a chef I already had some ideas as to what should be included in a recipe app. A lot of the other features came to with all the user research. I was able to take what features users wanted to see in an app and
          implement them into the design.</p>

        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p>Just like the wireframes the user flow came together after spending some time with pen and paper. For me it is a quick and easy way to get your ideas down and fix mistakes or other flows you might not have seen yet before putting them on
          screen.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>The wireframes really came together after using the crazy 8's method. I compiled things I liked from a bunch of different sketches to come up with my main lo-fi wireframes. This method proved to be fun and very useful. From there I was
          able to get all the screens on the computer and see how all my sizes were going to look.</p>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>User interviews and research really helped define the final design of the project. I know at times you might not be able to include everything you might learn from users but in this case I was able to satisfy my users wants and needs.</p>

      <div>
        <p>I learned to love the process on this project. At the end of this project looking back I really liked the research process and getting to interact with users. I am grateful for all the users that give their time and input so I can design
          better for them.</p>
